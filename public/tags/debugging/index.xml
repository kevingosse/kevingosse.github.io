      <description>Writing native WinDbg extensions in C# It has already been possible for a long time to write WinDbg extensions in C#, for instance using ClrMD as described by Christophe Nasarre in this article. However, it has a few serious drawbacks:&#xA;Dependencies are tricky to manage, unless you store all the extension files in the same folder as WinDbg&#xA;Because of the tricks used to manage dependencies, you can run into conflicts if you simultaneously load multiple extensions written in C#</description>

      <title>Reading AsyncLocal values from a memory dump</title>

      <description>This article explains how AsyncLocal values are stored in .NET and how to retrieve them from a memory dump. Note that the code provided is written for .NET 5, but should be able to work for .NET Framework with minor modifications (the name of some internal fields have changed across versions).&#xA;Preparing the memory dump First thing first, we need to prepare the memory dump that will serve as example for the whole article.</description>

      <title>Analyze your memory dumps in C# with DynaMD</title>

      <description>Whenever you need to analyze complex structures in a .NET memory dump, the WinDbg scripting API quickly shows its limits. In those cases, you can instead use the ClrMD library, that will give you everything you need to inspect the memory dump from C# code.&#xA;Not everything is perfect however, and sometimes I feel like the ClrMD syntax does not feel &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; enough. To take one concrete example, for an investigation I had to retrieve the URLs of the pending HTTP requests in a memory dump.</description>

      <description>The crash This one started when trying to understand why an integration test was failing, only on Linux with ARM64.&#xA;As I had no ARM64 dev environment available, I first tried adding more and more traces and let the test run in the CI, without much success.&#xA;Eventually, I realized this was leading nowhere, and took the time to setup an ARM64 VM to investigate further. After running the test with LLDB (see my previous article to learn how to fetch the symbols for the CLR), I found out that the process was raising two segmentations faults, and the second one caused the crash:</description>

      <description>This story begins when one of our integrations tests started got stuck on one PR that seemingly impacted unrelated code. This is a nice excuse to cover some concepts I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in my previous articles, such as downloading the .NET symbols on Linux.&#xA;Preliminary inspection The failure was occurring in a Linux test. After a while, I managed to reproduce the issue locally in a docker container. Usually the first step would be to attach a debugger, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the time to find the commands to inject the debugger in the container.</description>

The profiler works by rewriting the IL of interesting methods to inject instrumentation code. The InvalidProgramException is thrown by the JIT when trying to compile the IL emitted by the profiler, which must be somehow invalid.</description>

      <description>Datadog automated instrumentation for .NET works by rewriting the IL of interesting methods to emit traces that are then sent to the back-end. This is a complex piece of logic, written using the profiler API, and ridden with corner-cases. And as always with complex code, bugs are bound to happen, and those can be very difficult to diagnose.&#xA;As it turns out, we had customer reports of applications throwing InvalidProgramException when using our instrumentation.</description>

To test this, I needed a way to check on live servers whether the events were activated.&#xA;Note: the whole article is about .net core on Linux. While the first part (implementation) can be transposed to any OS, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the second part could be done on Windows without installing additional tools.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday! And when it&amp;rsquo;s Friday and your computer is managed by Criteo, you have a chance to get this nice popup:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to warn me that my computer is going to restart in a few hours. But it would be even better if the &amp;ldquo;Hide&amp;rdquo; button wasn&amp;rsquo;t grayed out. To make things better, the close button doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either, and the window is top-most. So the only choices you have is either to restart now or to spend the Friday with this window eating your precious screen real estate.</description>

      <description>The SOS extension for WinDbg defines a command, !DumpStackObjects (or !dso), that allows to list all the references on the stack for a given thread. It&amp;rsquo;s convenient to retrieve the value of arguments or local variables of methods in the callstack. Recently, for an investigation, I ran across the need to dump those values for a few thousand threads. Obviously this is not something you&amp;rsquo;d want to do by hand, so I checked what was possible to do with ClrMD.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen through the years that debugging is often misunderstood. Many people that are unfamiliar with debugging tend to think it&amp;rsquo;s all about mastering difficult and austere tools. I often had coworkers ask me &amp;ldquo;what sequence of commands should I type in WinDbg to debug this kind of issue?&amp;rdquo;, as if debugging was about applying a simple flowchart with a complex tool. This is in fact quite the opposite. Debugging is all about the mindset and the methodology, and the tooling is the simple part.</description>

      <title>Writing ClrMD extensions for WinDbg and LLDB</title>

      <description>You may have already read the CriteoLabs article about how to write ClrMD extensions for WinDbg. As we move to Linux, we realized that we could not use our debugging toolbox anymore as it was written for WinDbg. Since LLDB is the common debugger for .net NET Core on Linux, I decided to write a compatibility layer to be able to load our extensions in the new environment. And while I was at it, I tried to make the overall process of writing such a debugger extension a bit simpler.</description>
