      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen through the years that debugging is often misunderstood. Many people that are unfamiliar with debugging tend to think it&amp;rsquo;s all about mastering difficult and austere tools. I often had coworkers ask me &amp;ldquo;what sequence of commands should I type in WinDbg to debug this kind of issue?&amp;rdquo;, as if debugging was about applying a simple flowchart with a complex tool. This is in fact quite the opposite. Debugging is all about the mindset and the methodology, and the tooling is the simple part.</description>
