      <description>While working on the second edition of the Pro .NET Memory Management book, I did some research on the SuppressGCTransition attribute introduced in .NET 5, and figured it would make a nice complimentary article.&#xA;SuppressGCTransition is an attribute you can only apply on a method decorated with the DllImport attribute. It greatly reduces the overhead of the p/invoke, as illustrated with this benchmark:&#xA;public class SuppressGcTransitionBenchmark { [Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public int PInvoke() { return Increment(42); [DllImport(&amp;#34;NativeLib.</description>

      <title>Writing a .NET profiler in C# — Part 4</title>

      <description>In part 1, we saw how NativeAOT can allow us to write a profiler in C#, and how to expose a fake COM object to use the profiling API. In part 2, we refined the solution to use instance methods instead of static methods. In part 3, we automated the process using a source generator. At this point, we have everything we need to expose an instance of ICorProfilerCallback. However, to write a profiler we also need to be able to call methods from ICorProfilerInfo, this will be the subject of this part.</description>

      <description>Consider the following code:&#xA;private static readonly ReadonlyStruct Struct; public static void Read() { Console.WriteLine(Struct.Value); } public struct ReadonlyStruct { public ReadonlyStruct(int value) { Value = value; } public int Value; } This looks pretty straightforward, right? We store a struct in a readonly field, and read it.&#xA;Yet, what happens if we try to run this program in .NET Framework under partial trust?&#xA;static void Main(string[] args) { var permissionSet = new PermissionSet(PermissionState.</description>

In part 2, we refined the solution to use instance methods instead of static methods. Now that we know how to interact with the profiling API, we&amp;rsquo;re going to write a source generator to automatically generate the boilerplate code needed to implement the 70+ methods declared in the ICorProfilerCallback interface.</description>

      <description>In the first part, we saw how to mimick the layout of a COM object, and use it to expose a fake instance of IClassFactory. It worked nicely, but our solution used static methods, so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be convenient to track the state of the objects whenever multiple instances are expected. It would be great if we could map our COM object to an actual instance of an object in .</description>

      <description>[C#] Using GC.KeepAlive in async methods Can you figure out what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this code?&#xA;var taskCompletionSource = new TaskCompletionSource(); MyDelegateType myDelegate = () =&amp;gt; taskCompletionSource.SetResult(); NativeMethods.MyNativeMethod(myDelegate); await taskCompletionSource.Task; GC.KeepAlive(myDelegate); It turns out that when running in an actual application, there is a probability that myDelegate will get collected despite the call to GC.KeepAlive.&#xA;This code was posted in an issue in the dotnet/runtime repository, and I followed it closely because I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell what the error was.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, a github issue in the dotnet/runtime repository piqued my interest. To summarize, the author was wondering why their code wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as expected. Here is a simplified version:&#xA;public unsafe class Getter { private delegate*&amp;lt;Obj, SomeStruct&amp;gt; _functionPointer; public Getter(string propName) { var methodInfo = typeof(Obj).GetProperty(propName).GetGetMethod(); _functionPointer = (delegate*&amp;lt;Obj, SomeStruct&amp;gt;)methodInfo.MethodHandle.GetFunctionPointer(); } public SomeStruct GetFromFunctionPointer(Obj target) { var v = _functionPointer(target); return v; } } public struct SomeStruct { public int Value1; public int Value2; public int Value3; public int Value4; } public class Obj { public SomeStruct Property { get; set; } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var obj = new Obj { Property = new SomeStruct { Value1 = 42 } }; var getter = new Getter(&amp;#34;Property&amp;#34;); Console.</description>

      <description>.NET has a very powerful profiling API, that allows to closely monitor the runtime, dynamically rewrite methods during execution, walk the callstack of threads at arbitrary points in time, and much more. However, the entry cost to learn how to use that API is quite high. The first reason is that many features require a good knowledge of how the .NET metadata system works. The other reason is that all the documentation and examples are written in C++.</description>

      <description>Writing native WinDbg extensions in C# It has already been possible for a long time to write WinDbg extensions in C#, for instance using ClrMD as described by Christophe Nasarre in this article. However, it has a few serious drawbacks:&#xA;Dependencies are tricky to manage, unless you store all the extension files in the same folder as WinDbg&#xA;Because of the tricks used to manage dependencies, you can run into conflicts if you simultaneously load multiple extensions written in C#</description>

      <description>This article explains how AsyncLocal values are stored in .NET and how to retrieve them from a memory dump. Note that the code provided is written for .NET 5, but should be able to work for .NET Framework with minor modifications (the name of some internal fields have changed across versions).&#xA;Preparing the memory dump First thing first, we need to prepare the memory dump that will serve as example for the whole article.</description>

      <description>Whenever you need to analyze complex structures in a .NET memory dump, the WinDbg scripting API quickly shows its limits. In those cases, you can instead use the ClrMD library, that will give you everything you need to inspect the memory dump from C# code.&#xA;Not everything is perfect however, and sometimes I feel like the ClrMD syntax does not feel &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; enough. To take one concrete example, for an investigation I had to retrieve the URLs of the pending HTTP requests in a memory dump.</description>

      <description>One thing that has bothered me quite a bit with PerfView is how it groups all unresolved frames under the same &amp;ldquo;?!?&amp;rdquo; name. I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s a way to reduce noise, but when trying to reduce the CPU usage of an application it can be unsettling.&#xA;Take the following example:&#xA;Here, &amp;ldquo;?!?&amp;rdquo; is presented as top offender, accounting for more than 7% of the total CPU usage. But I&amp;rsquo;m missing critical information to know whether I should consider it as a bottleneck or not.</description>

      <description>The crash This one started when trying to understand why an integration test was failing, only on Linux with ARM64.&#xA;As I had no ARM64 dev environment available, I first tried adding more and more traces and let the test run in the CI, without much success.&#xA;Eventually, I realized this was leading nowhere, and took the time to setup an ARM64 VM to investigate further. After running the test with LLDB (see my previous article to learn how to fetch the symbols for the CLR), I found out that the process was raising two segmentations faults, and the second one caused the crash:</description>

      <description>This story begins when one of our integrations tests started got stuck on one PR that seemingly impacted unrelated code. This is a nice excuse to cover some concepts I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in my previous articles, such as downloading the .NET symbols on Linux.&#xA;Preliminary inspection The failure was occurring in a Linux test. After a while, I managed to reproduce the issue locally in a docker container. Usually the first step would be to attach a debugger, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the time to find the commands to inject the debugger in the container.</description>

      <description>In this series of article, we&amp;rsquo;re retracing how I debugged an InvalidProgramException, caused by a bug in the Datadog profiler, from a memory dump sent by a customer.&#xA;Part 1: Preliminary exploration&#xA;Part 2: Finding the generated IL&#xA;Part 3: Identifying the error and fixing the bug&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick reminder. The profiler works by rewriting the IL of interesting methods to inject instrumentation code. The InvalidProgramException is thrown by the JIT when trying to compile the IL emitted by the profiler, which must be somehow invalid.</description>

      <description>Datadog automated instrumentation for .NET works by rewriting the IL of interesting methods to emit traces that are then sent to the back-end. This is a complex piece of logic, written using the profiler API, and ridden with corner-cases. And as always with complex code, bugs are bound to happen, and those can be very difficult to diagnose.&#xA;As it turns out, we had customer reports of applications throwing InvalidProgramException when using our instrumentation.</description>

      <description>The Datadog .NET tracer uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the agent (usually installed on the same machine) and send traces every second. We originally used HttpClient to handle the communication. However, we ran into some dependencies errors on .NET Framework (it&amp;rsquo;s a bit complicated and outside of the scope of the article, but it has something to do with us instrumenting the System.Net.HttpClient assembly while at the same time having a dependency on it), and so we decided to switch to HttpWebRequest.</description>

      <description>.NET core startup hooks is a feature I really like, and I had a lot of fun with it in the past. Still, I had yet to find a legitimate use for them, and the opportunity finally came a few days ago.&#xA;What are startup hooks? Let&amp;rsquo;s start by a quick catch-up, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what startup hooks are. The feature was introduced with .net core 2.2, and allows to execute any arbitrary code in a .</description>

      <description>… and find an unexpected bug in the process&#xA;We recently ran into performance issues, and many elements seemed to point towards the GC verbose events being enabled. To test this, I needed a way to check on live servers whether the events were activated.&#xA;Note: the whole article is about .net core on Linux. While the first part (implementation) can be transposed to any OS, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the second part could be done on Windows without installing additional tools.</description>

      <title>Performance best practices in C#</title>

      <description>As I recently had to compile a list of best practices in C# for Criteo, I figured it would be nice to share it publicly. The goal of this article is to provide a non-exhaustive list of code patterns to avoid, either because they&amp;rsquo;re risky or because they perform poorly. The list may seem a bit random because it&amp;rsquo;s out of context, but all the items have been spotted in our code at some point and have caused production issues.</description>

      <description>There has been plenty of talk about ThreadPool starvation in .NET:&#xA;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2018/10/16/diagnosing-net-core-threadpool-starvation-with-perfview-why-my-service-is-not-saturating-all-cores-or-seems-to-stall/&#xA;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vsoservice/?p=17665&#xA;Or even on the Criteo&amp;rsquo;s blog: http://labs.criteo.com/2018/09/monitor-finalizers-contention-and-threads-in-your-application/&#xA;What is it about? This is one of the numerous ways asynchronous code can break if you wait synchronously on a task.&#xA;To illustrate that, consider a web server that would execute this code:&#xA;/// ProcessRequest is called for every new request public void ProcessRequest() { DoSomethingAsync().Wait(); } You start an asynchronous operation (DoSomethingAsync) then block the current thread.</description>

      <description>(for context, this article was written during the containment period in 2020)&#xA;In those days of isolation, finding ways to get a regular physical activity is important, both for health and moral. It turns out that I own a training bike, so it was a good opportunity to take it back from wherever it had been stored for years (yeah, like you kept using it).&#xA;I tend to use the bike while watching series to make it less boring.</description>

      <description>It may seem weird that in 2020 I would write an article on this subject. But I found a new approach to this problem that I had some fun experimenting with.&#xA;So what is the problem, to begin with?&#xA;A quick reminder In WinForms/WPF/UWP, you can only update controls from the UI thread. If you have code running in a background thread that needs to update some controls, you need to somehow switch to the UI thread.</description>

      <description>One of my pet project is writing a custom command window for WinDbg. When testing that custom command window with big outputs, I quickly noticed that the performance was unacceptable: the first few lines would be displayed smoothly, then the application would become slower and slower until almost freezing. I therefore decided to optimize my implementation: tweaking the rendering code, batching updates, … But no matter what I did, the performance was still bad.</description>

      <title>Memory alignment of doubles in C#</title>
      <link>https://minidump.net/memory-alignment-of-doubles-in-c-1d13e3ce741/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I mentioned on Twitter an interesting quirk of objects in .NET: when running in 64 bits, objects are aligned on a 8-bytes boundary despite having a 32 bits header, and therefore 32 bits are &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; before each object:&#xA;It bothers me so much that on #dotnet on 64-bit, 4 bytes are wasted for *every class instance* because objects are aligned on a 8 bytes boundary and the header has a fixed size of 4 bytes.</description>
