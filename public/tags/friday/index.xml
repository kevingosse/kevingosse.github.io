      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday! And when it&amp;rsquo;s Friday and your computer is managed by Criteo, you have a chance to get this nice popup:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to warn me that my computer is going to restart in a few hours. But it would be even better if the &amp;ldquo;Hide&amp;rdquo; button wasn&amp;rsquo;t grayed out. To make things better, the close button doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either, and the window is top-most. So the only choices you have is either to restart now or to spend the Friday with this window eating your precious screen real estate.</description>
