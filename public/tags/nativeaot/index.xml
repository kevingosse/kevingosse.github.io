      <title>Writing a .NET profiler in C# — Part 4</title>

      <description>In part 1, we saw how NativeAOT can allow us to write a profiler in C#, and how to expose a fake COM object to use the profiling API. In part 2, we refined the solution to use instance methods instead of static methods. In part 3, we automated the process using a source generator. At this point, we have everything we need to expose an instance of ICorProfilerCallback. However, to write a profiler we also need to be able to call methods from ICorProfilerInfo, this will be the subject of this part.</description>

      <description>In part 1, we saw how NativeAOT can allow us to write a profiler in C#, and how to expose a fake COM object to use the profiling API. In part 2, we refined the solution to use instance methods instead of static methods. Now that we know how to interact with the profiling API, we&amp;rsquo;re going to write a source generator to automatically generate the boilerplate code needed to implement the 70+ methods declared in the ICorProfilerCallback interface.</description>

      <description>In the first part, we saw how to mimic the layout of a COM object, and use it to expose a fake instance of IClassFactory. It worked nicely, but our solution used static methods, so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be convenient to track the state of the objects whenever multiple instances are expected. It would be great if we could map our COM object to an actual instance of an object in .</description>

      <description>.NET has a very powerful profiling API, that allows to closely monitor the runtime, dynamically rewrite methods during execution, walk the callstack of threads at arbitrary points in time, and much more. However, the entry cost to learn how to use that API is quite high. The first reason is that many features require a good knowledge of how the .NET metadata system works. The other reason is that all the documentation and examples are written in C++.</description>

      <description>Writing native WinDbg extensions in C# It has already been possible for a long time to write WinDbg extensions in C#, for instance using ClrMD as described by Christophe Nasarre in this article. However, it has a few serious drawbacks:&#xA;Dependencies are tricky to manage, unless you store all the extension files in the same folder as WinDbg&#xA;Because of the tricks used to manage dependencies, you can run into conflicts if you simultaneously load multiple extensions written in C#</description>
